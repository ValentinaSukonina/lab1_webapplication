                The enchanting world of the Dolomites - ancient legends and myths 
                characterise the famous pale mountains. Already some 200 million years ago those 
                mountains were formed, which got their name from a limestone rock called dolomite

                Between those mighty pale mountains lies the Fassa Valley, with a rich number 
                of hiking trails taking you right to the heart of the beautiful natural scenery 
                called Dolomites. The valley is characterised by the Avisio river and thanks to such famous mountains 
                as the Sella Group or legendary Marmolada it is one of the most renowned Alpine valleys.

                Numerous trails take you across Val di Fassa and high up to the peaks of the Sella, 
                Sassolungo and Marmolada mountains. From the highest peak of the Gruppo Sella, the Piz Bo√©, 
                you can enjoy a splendid view on the Val di Fassa valley. In the western part of the alpenstock, 
                which belongs to the Dolomites, there are the famous Torri di Sella, which are very popular 
                with climbers and alpinists.

                A phenomenon, for which the Dolomites are known worldwide is the alpine glow, also 
                called "enrosadira", which begins at dusk, when the red gleams of the setting sun are 
                reflected. The alpine glow transforms the Dolomites into a fairytale-like landscape!
