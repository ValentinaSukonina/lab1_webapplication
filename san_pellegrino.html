                In the heart of the Dolomites, there exists a magical place tucked 
                between the regions of Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige.

                This enchanting spot is steeped in rich history and offers stunning 
                panoramic views, vast green meadows, and towering peaks. It's a place 
                where each summer day promises unforgettable adventures and exhilarating
                 excursions. Indeed, this place is real, and it goes by the name of Ski 
                 Area San Pellegrino: a small slice of paradise eagerly awaiting your

                Starting from the mountain stations of the Costabella chairlift and the Col Margherita
                 cable car, one can embark on numerous hikes that also have historical significance, 
                 retracing the steps of the bloody battles that took place during the First World War 
                 between the Italian army and the Austro-Hungarian troops. Along the way, we can see 
                 the remains of barracks, covered passages, wooden ladders and machine gun emplacements, 
                 as if in a real open-air museum.
